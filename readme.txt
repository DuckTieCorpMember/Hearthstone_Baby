Thank you for reading this :)

1) Please use only CreateAndFillBase.sql to generate the database,
since it also inserts all initial information. Also, I had some problems
when tried to set onupdate and ondelete properties of a key in Workbench,
so .mwb file does not contain those, however I did it manually in .sql file

2) Change database connection parameters in WebsiteFiles/php/db_class.php!
